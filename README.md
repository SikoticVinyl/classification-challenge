# Spam Detector Project

## Overview
This project implements a spam detection system using machine learning techniques. It serves as a practical application and refresher of recent learnings in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- `spam_detector.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main project code
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project

## Techniques Used
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Loading and lightly exploring the dataset
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets
   - Scaling features using StandardScaler

2. Model Implementation
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier

3. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy score comparison

## Key Findings
- The Random Forest Classifier outperformed Logistic Regression in spam detection accuracy.
- The project confirmed the effectiveness of ensemble methods like Random Forest for complex, high-dimensional classification tasks.

## Reflections
This project served as a valuable refresher on machine learning techniques, particularly in the context of spam detection. It reinforced understanding of:
- The importance of choosing appropriate algorithms based on problem characteristics
- The power of ensemble methods in handling complex datasets
- The process of comparing and evaluating different machine learning models

While the project didn't delve into advanced tuning or optimization, it provided a solid foundation for future, more in-depth explorations of spam detection and machine learning applications.
